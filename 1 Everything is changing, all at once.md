After six years of living in a small apartment in a mostly solitary existence
my life is about to radically change.

I sold my furniture, parked my car long-term, and bought a one way ticket to
Ireland. It will be my first international flight.

From July 4th to the 14th I'll explore the country with my father.

From July 14th to July 30th, I'll hike the Ireland Way; A 1,000km trail
that spans the entire North/South axis of the country. There will be video
footage of part of that. I'm not sure I have enough time to do the whole
thing, but I'll try.

On July 30th and 31st I'll run two back-to-back marathons in Mullingar, County
Westmeath at [the Celtic Warrior](https://celticwarrior.ie/). I don't plan to
film this, but maybe I'll journal about my training.

In August, I start a nine month tech boot camp on WAS. These nine months will be
the culmination of five years of self-study on functional programming, computer
science, DevOps, Linux, and problem solving. I hope to capture some valuable
lessons. Hopefully I'll make some nerdy friends along the way. At the end, I'll
find a job as a Cloud Engineer, and work remote.

During August I'll be traveling and working out of co-working spaces. I consider
this to be the real start of my new nomadic lifestyle. First Amsterdam for a few
days, then the Canary Islands for a few weeks. I'll have to balance intensive
study, intellectual work, and fitness with world travel during this time.
